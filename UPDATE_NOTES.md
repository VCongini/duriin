# Update notes

- Applied the lighter devlog-inspired page sections across Home, Blog, Videos, and About using shared `page-section` and `page-card` styles.
- Added theme tokens for subtle page borders and floating cards to keep brutalist/modern and light/dark modes consistent.
- Refreshed the Videos and About layouts to float on the global background with focused cards and grid spacing.
- Simplified the brutalist dark background to a cleaner gradient so the layout stays balanced without visual noise.
